SMS Spam Classifier ‚Äì Neural Network

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python certification. It uses a neural network to classify SMS messages as either "ham" (not spam) or "spam", trained using the SMS Spam Collection dataset.


Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether an SMS message is spam or ham. It uses a Bidirectional LSTM neural network implemented with TensorFlow/Keras and trained on pre-split data.


What the Model Does

Tokenizes and pads input text messages

Trains on labeled SMS messages (ham/spam)

Uses a Bidirectional LSTM network for sequence understanding

Predicts a probability + label using the predict_message() function

How to Use It
Open the notebook in Google Colab

Run each cell in order (make sure to train the model before testing)

Use the predict_message("your message here") function to classify new SMS messages

Run the test cell to check if the model passes all test cases

Model Architecture
Embedding Layer (input_dim=1000, output_dim=32)

Bidirectional LSTM Layer (units=32)

Global Max Pooling

Dense Layer (ReLU)

Output Layer (Sigmoid)

Result
Once trained correctly, the model passes the final test and prints:
