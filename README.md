SMS Spam Classifier â€“ Neural Network

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python certification. It uses a neural network to classify SMS messages as either "ham" (not spam) or "spam", trained using the SMS Spam Collection dataset.



Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether an SMS message is spam or ham. It uses a Bidirectional LSTM neural network implemented with TensorFlow/Keras and trained on pre-split data.



What the Model Does

- Tokenizes and pads input text messages

- Trains on labeled SMS messages (ham/spam)

- Uses a Bidirectional LSTM network for sequence understanding

- Predicts a probability + label using the predict_message() function



How to Use It

- Open the notebook in Google Colab

- Run each cell in order (make sure to train the model before testing)

- Use the predict_message("your message here") function to classify new SMS messages

- Run the test cell to check if the model passes all test cases



Model Architecture

- Embedding Layer (input_dim=1000, output_dim=32)

- Bidirectional LSTM Layer (units=32)

- Global Max Pooling

- Dense Layer (ReLU)

- Output Layer (Sigmoid)



Result

Once trained correctly, the model passes the final test and prints:

You passed the challenge. Great job!
